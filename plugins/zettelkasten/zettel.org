#+TITLE: Zettelkasten-mode

* What
  
  This is an Emacs minor mode for enabling the [[https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/?utm_source=pocket_mylist][Zettelkasten method]]. My
  intention is to make it easier to work on a markdown-based
  Zettelkasten inside Emacs.

* Requirements

  + Markdown-mode
  + Markdown wiki mode (to enable wiki style links)

* Cruft code

  This is the "original" prototype of the code which was not written
  in a literate fashion. My intention is to refactor this until it is
  cleaner. I'd also like to start new features.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (define-minor-mode zettelkasten-mode
      "Toggle zettelkasten mode. 
    You shold probably bind 'zettel-create-new"
      :lighter " Zettel"
      :global t
      (setq markdown-enable-wiki-links t)

      ;; Override this to get a different date file format
      (setq zettel-date-command "date +%Y-%m-%d_%k-%m-%S")

      ;; Override this to get a totally different file name if you'd like. Ex, make it
      ;; interactive and provide a string
      (defun zettel-get-file-name ()
	(substring
	 (shell-command-to-string zettel-date-command)
	 0 ; Start from the beginning of the screen
	 -1)) ; Go to the character before the end of the string. This discards a final newline

      ;; The path to your zettelkasten
      (setq zettel-path "~/Dropbox/zettelkasten")

      ;; Creates a new buffer for a particular file, set up the backing file for that
      ;; buffer to your provided path.
      (defun create-buffer-for-file-and-switch (new-file-path)
	(switch-to-buffer
	 (create-file-buffer new-file-path))
	(set-visited-file-name new-file-path))

      ;; Create a new note in your zettelkasten using your name format
      (defun zettel-create-new ()
	(interactive) 
	(setq path (concat
		    zettel-path
		    "/"
		    (zettel-get-file-name)
		    ".md"))
	(create-buffer-for-file-and-switch path)))

    (provide 'zettelkasten-mode)
  #+END_SRC
* Whishlist
** TODO Insert method

   The insert mehtod should basically call ~zettel-create-new~ but
   should also insert a link to the new file at wherever the current
   point is.
